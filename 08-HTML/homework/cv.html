            <p>
                Hi ! My name's Santiago Diaz. I'm 24 years old. I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I had worked on finance for many years but i left the sector on 2020. I discover programming 3 years ago but it wasn't until i decided to change my career that i start to program and learn how to improve. 
                Nowadays i'm proud of this change, because programming it's a sector full of challanges and a world of possibilities, these resaons keeps me motivated and with big ambitions.

            <h3><strong>Why i choose Henry career?</strong></h3>
            <p>
                I have look for a place where I can learn the essentials of computer science, few programming languages, frameworks, and a bit of understanding about working in technology enterprises. I did online courses in CoderHouse, Udemy, Coursera, FreeCodeCamp, Codecademy but I wasn't enough to find a job and even to learn what I want. I realized I need an organized and structured program and in that moment I heard about Henry.'It fits with me' that's what I said at the first moment that I read the Henry program. 
                I discovered in programming a perfect world for people like me (someone full of project ideas). I want to get deep into computer science and I think choosing Henry is a good beginning.
